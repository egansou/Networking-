# Overlay Routing & Distributed Transaction Processing
The goal of this project is to build an overlay routing system, at the application layer, that uses Link State routing to pass messages between arbitrary nodes. The application layer processes on a given node, connect to application layer processes on other nodes to build routing tables and pass messages.
